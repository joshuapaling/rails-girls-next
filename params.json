{"name":"Rails Girls Next","tagline":"February 19, 2014 Sydney","body":"# Welcome to Rails Girls Next!\r\n\r\nWe are very excited to have you at Rails Girls Next. Hopefully you'll come away with a better understanding of Ruby and how the internet works!\r\n\r\n## Schedule\r\n\r\n### Registration and coffee (9:30 - 9:45)\r\nDuring the morning we'll have some coffee, thanks to Ruby Conf AU, so that we're all set for a great day of Rails Girls!\r\n\r\n### Welcome (9:45 - 10:00)\r\nOutline of the day - since you have Ruby installed already, we can jump right into it.\r\n\r\nWe've broken the day down into 3 exercises so you can practice a few different things. There's no particular order, the list below is just a possible outline.\r\n\r\n### Coding with Ruby (10:00 - 11:30)\r\nAt Rails Girls you got to play with Ruby a bit, but now it's time to really understand some of its features and syntax.\r\n\r\n### Fun with Sinatra (11:45 - 1:00)\r\nTo give you a better foundation about how the web works, you'll build a simple website using Sinatra. It will be more hands-on than your original Rails Girls site, so be ready to write some code!\r\n\t\r\n### Lunch (1:00 - 2:00)\r\nDelicious food from Ruby Conf AU.\r\n\t\r\n### Test Driven Development (2:00 - 3:30)\r\nLearn a new way to code (and avoid errors!) by writing tests as you go.\r\n\t\r\n### Retro (3:30 - 4:00)\r\nWe'll go over everything we did for the day, and hear about your experiences from the day.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
